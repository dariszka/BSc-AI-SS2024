### Repository Structure
This repository organizes different programming assignments done during my second semester into individual folders for each subject. Each folder contains a README with an overview and details of the key tasks performed. The structure is designed to showcase a progression of skills in data analysis, machine learning, and deep learning. All projects done by me, all summaries done by ChatGPT.

### Hands-On AI II
Second semester course.

This course built on foundational AI techniques, introducing advanced concepts and practical implementations. Topics included logistic regression, neural networks, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and LSTM networks for language modeling. Critical issues such as the vanishing gradient problem and advanced applications like drug discovery were also explored. Assignments emphasized the use of PyTorch for deep learning, covering optimization techniques, network architectures, and model evaluation, while working on real-world datasets and implementing key concepts, such as gradient computation and handling overfitting through regularization techniques.

This collection showcases proficiency in modern AI frameworks and deep learning methods, with an emphasis on both theoretical understanding and practical skills in neural network training and optimization.
